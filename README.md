# üî© BoltPool - High-Performance Temporary Memory Pool for Bolt Protocol Decoding (still work in progress)

`BoltPool` is a high-speed, zero-allocation-on-fast-path memory pool designed for temporary allocation of Bolt protocol data structures (e.g., `BoltValue`, `List`, `Struct`, `Map`). It provides an efficient two-tiered memory allocation system optimized for minimal memory overhead, maximum locality, and rapid reuse across decoding cycles or queries.

## üß± Architecture Overview

BoltPool internally combines:

- **`ScratchBuffer<T, N>`** ‚Äì a fixed-size, cache-aligned static buffer for ultra-fast allocation without heap usage.
- **`ArenaAllocator<T>`** ‚Äì a dynamically growing heap-backed arena for larger or overflow allocations.
- **`BoltPool<T>`** ‚Äì a hybrid allocator that transparently uses both layers and tracks allocations for rollback.

All allocations are recorded, enabling deterministic `Release()` behavior in reverse order, similar to a stack allocator.

## üì¶ Components

### `ScratchBuffer<T, N>`
- Allocates from a fixed-size buffer aligned to 64 bytes (cache-line).
- Provides fast allocations with zero malloc overhead.
- Useful for small or frequent allocations.

### `ArenaAllocator<T>`
- Manages a heap-based dynamic memory pool.
- Grows automatically using `realloc()` when capacity is exceeded.
- Allocations are contiguous, reducing fragmentation.

### `BoltPool<T>`
- Tries to allocate from `ScratchBuffer` first, then overflows to `ArenaAllocator`.
- Maintains a log (`alloc_log`) of allocation sources for safe `Release()`.
- Allows memory reuse via `Reset_All()` between decoding sessions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage

```cpp
// Get a thread-local instance of the pool
auto& pool = GetBoltPool<BoltValue>();

// Allocate memory for 10 BoltValues
size_t offset = pool.Alloc(10);

// Resolve raw pointer from offset
BoltValue* values = pool.Resolve(offset);

// Use values...

// Release last 10 allocations (LIFO)
pool.Release(10);

// Or reset the entire pool
pool.Reset_All();
